### Reactions

---

When doing public speaking you need a feedback from your audience. With this simple app you can create a live room and specify a set of reactions for your audience. Audience members connect to the room and react to what you say. Their reactions are all displayed as single color box that allows you to understand what the listeners are thinking or feeleng about your 
speech.

This code is a **development version** of the app. The app runs on your local machine.

You can create a room and connect to it from your local network devices. For the demonstration purposes several dozens of fake audience members will be added to the room.
